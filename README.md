# AirBnB clone
## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

* put in place a parent class (called **BaseModel**) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from **BaseModel**
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## command interprete
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
